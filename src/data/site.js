    "PRISM, this edition's theme, grew out of a simple observation: the hardest questions facing the world right now don't come from a single direction. Peace, rights, integrity, statecraft and morality aren't five separate debates — they're five angles on the same conflicts, refracting the same light differently depending on where you stand. So we built our committees to hold all five at once.",
